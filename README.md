This repo test MBTI for *gpt3.5* and *gpt4o*.   

The MBTI analyzes personality on 4 dimensions, each containing 2 opposing preferences:   

1. **Extraversion E-Introversion I:** representing the different sources of energy in each person.
2. **Sensing S - Intuition N:** representing different brain preferences for sensing.
3. **Thinking T - Feeling F:** Representing different brain preferences for judgment.
4. **judgment J - perception P:** whether perception or judgment plays a dominant role in people's adaptation to the external environment.

We test each [MBTI question](./mbti_questions.json) for each language model for 3 times and get their preferences on 4 dimensions according to the number of answers with different preferences for each dimension. *[Here is a streamlit web page of result](https://derekwang2002-streamlit-repo-web-gyx7yx.streamlit.app/)*

## 1. Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Store your keys

In order to hide sensitive information (API keys), you should store your keys in `.env` file (which should be ignored by git) like:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx
```

And include in your code like:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # take environment variables from .env.

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

If you don't have `dotenv`, install first:

```
pip install python-dotenv
```

## 3. Get MBTI for GPT3.5 and GPT4o
*(In 'srr' folder)*

Use `mbti_questions.json` in `gpt-api-starter.ipynb`, we get result in `llms_mbti.json`, includes **answer details, MBTI type, token and money cost**.
